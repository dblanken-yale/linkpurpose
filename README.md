# Link Purpose

Vanilla JS to mark external links, links that open in new windows, links to documents and links that send emails.

The last word of the link is also wrapped into a span with the icon, preventing line breaks between the text and the icon.

You can also bring your own icons: inline SVG, remote img files and class-based symbol fonts (e.g. FontAwesome) are supported.

## Basic use

Attach the JS and (optionally) the default CSS:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="../css/linkpurpose.css">

<script src="../js/linkpurpose.js"></script>
```

And then call the library, specifying any URLS that should be treated as internal links
```
<script>

    const linkPurpose = new LinkPurpose({
        
        domain: 'https://example.com, https://example.dev',
   
    })

</script>
```

And that's it. 


## Overriding classes and icons

Default parameters may be overridden when calling the library.

E.g., to set your own classes for all marked links, override the "base" classes:

```
<script>
    const linkPurpose = new LinkPurpose({
        base: {
            linkClass: 'my-better-class',
            iconWrapperClass: 'my-better-icon-class',
        }
    })
</script>
```

You only have to list options you want to override; any "missing" keys will fall back to the defaults.

### Using class-based icon fonts 

This assumes you already have a class-based library on the page. 

Here's an example configuration that switches all four icons to use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/docs/web/setup/get-started) classes rather than the included inline ([Material](https://fonts.google.com/icons)) icons:

```
external: {
    iconType: 'classes',
},

document: {
    iconType: 'classes',
},

mailTo: {
    iconType: 'classes',
},

newWindow: {
    iconType: 'classes',
},
```

You can override some or all of the default icons at the same time using the "iconClasses" key:
```
mailTo: {
    iconType: 'classes',
    iconClasses: ['fa-regular','fa-face-smile'],
},
```

### Using image files
Switch the iconType to SRC and provide your image's source URL:
```
external: {
    iconType: 'src',
    iconSRC: '/example/theme/folder/new-window.png',
},

document: {
    iconType: 'src',
    iconSRC: '/example/theme/folder/document.png',
},

mailTo: {
    iconType: 'src',
    iconSRC: '/example/theme/folder/mailto.png',
},

newWindow: {
    iconType: 'src',
    iconSRC: '/example/theme/folder/new-window.png',
},
```
### Using inline SVG
This is the default icon type, so you just need to provide the SVG you want overridden. E.g.:
```
document: {
            iconHTML: '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" height="24" viewBox="0 -960 960 960" width="24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M360-240h240q17 0 28.5-11.5T640-280q0-17-11.5-28.5T600-320H360q-17 0-28.5 11.5T320-280q0 17 11.5 28.5T360-240Zm0-160h240q17 0 28.5-11.5T640-440q0-17-11.5-28.5T600-480H360q-17 0-28.5 11.5T320-440q0 17 11.5 28.5T360-400ZM240-80q-33 0-56.5-23.5T160-160v-640q0-33 23.5-56.5T240-880h287q16 0 30.5 6t25.5 17l194 194q11 11 17 25.5t6 30.5v447q0 33-23.5 56.5T720-80H240Zm280-560v-160H240v640h480v-440H560q-17 0-28.5-11.5T520-640ZM240-800v200-200 640-640Z"/></svg>',
}
```

## Translating and/or overriding the text provided to screen readers
Each of the four marked link types has a default hidden text provided to screen readers. Each can be overriden.
```
mailto: {
    message: '(Correo electr√≥nico)',
},
```

## Controlling which links get marked

Maybe you only want to mark links in the content area and footer...so provide your selectors for these regions in the "roots" option: 
```
roots: '.example-content-area, #example-footer',
```

Maybe the content area contains a widget with its own icons. Skip that by defining a CSS :not() selector for links you want ignored:
```
ignore: ':not(.example-widget a, #example-footer nav a, .example-ok-link)',
```

Or maybe the content area contains some shadow DOM / Web components, and you want the library to check within them:
```
shadowComponents: 'example-component-1, .example-component-2',
```

### Disabling a link category
Maybe you do not want to mark external links at all, only documents, emails and new windows. Each of the four can be disabled independently by negating its selector:
```
newWindow: {
    selector: false,
}
```

### Prevent marking certain pages

Maybe you have a dynamic, inline editing tool, and you do not want the DOM manipulated if it is present. Or maybe you only want the page modified if something is NOT present.
```
noRunIfPresent: '.example-editor-toolbar',

noRunIfAbsent: '.example-public-content-wrapper,
```

### Overriding selectors

Default selectors are provided for links (`a[href]`), as well as what links are mailTo, documents, etc.

Any of these selectors can be overridden if you want to mark more (or less). e.g.:
```
base: {
    selector: 'a[href], custom-link-tag[href]'
}
document: {
    selector: '[href$=\'.pdf\'], [href*=\'.latex?\']',
}
mailto: {
    selector: '[href^="mailto:"], [data-action-mail-to]',
}
```
